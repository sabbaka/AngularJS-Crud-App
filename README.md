=======

AngularJS test web application with Django REST API.

This is simple CRUD web app with Bootstrap, AngularJS and Django REST API. 
Also Angular UI and Angular Strap are used.
You can use this app as a simple example of webapp on AngularJS.

To run it please use virtualenv and install all requirments using "pip install -r requirements.txt".
And then use "python manage.py runserver" from same virtualenv.
After this open http://128.0.0.1:8000/ 

This app was created as a demo on my recent job as a learn practise. Django REST API was created by my co-worker. 
I made front-end.
